# About SDI4Apps Open Land Use Viewer
> The main goal of the project was to visualise the quality of land use HILUCS categories provided by the SDI4Apps Open Land Use dataset. The LAND COVER/USE STATISTICS (LUCAS) point dataset micro data was used to check the thematic accuracy of Land Use categories determined from various land use / cover resources as Urban Atlas, Open Street Map and Land Cover 2012. The final data were published as WMS/WFS and visualised with the Heatmap function provided by Geoserver WPS plugin and in a light Leaflet based web application.
